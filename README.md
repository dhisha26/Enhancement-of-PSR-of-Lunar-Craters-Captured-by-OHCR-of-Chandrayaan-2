# 🌑 Enhancement-of-PSR-of-Lunar-Craters-Captured-by-OHCR-of-Chandrayaan-2
Deep learning-based low-light image enhancement for lunar Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) with optimized noise reduction and reduced time complexity.

## 🚀 Project Overview  

Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the lunar poles receive extremely low solar illumination, making image analysis challenging due to poor visibility and high noise levels.  

This project develops an AI-powered deep learning framework to enhance low-light images captured by the Orbiter High Resolution Camera (OHRC) onboard Chandrayaan-2. The system improves visibility, reduces noise, and enhances faint surface details for accurate lunar mapping and exploration.
